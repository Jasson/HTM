  Programs to test if the core library is correctly working.

testSpLearn

    DISCRIPTION
        Contains one layer. Give a list of learning data and output the 
      number of quantization centers of each node.

    USAGE
        Once start, it requests input from stdin, which is a list of image
      file name seperated by newline('\n'), and for each round, output 
      plot command of gnuplot to stdout which plots the distribution of 
      the number of quantization centers of each node. 
        So you may want to use utility/image_sequence to generate a continuous
      sequence of image and then use: 

      $ ./testSpLearn < ../utility/img_seq/list.txt  | gnuplot

      to make a test.

testTpSort

    DISCRIPTION
        Test if function formTemporalGroup() in SpatialPooler.h (previously
      TemporalPooler.h) which devides the adjacency matrix from Sp, works
      correctly.
    
    USAGE
        No parameters. Run directly. Correct if output is

        !3
        the 0 is 1 !
        the 1 is 0 !
        the 2 is 1 !
        the 3 is 2 !
        the 4 is 1 !
        the 5 is 0 !
        the 6 is 0 !

testCpSubSpace

    DISCRIPTION
        Test if function copyFromSpaceToSubSpace() in Space.h, which copies
      the (data_t *) corresponding a subspace out of the givin (data_t *)
      corresponding its root space, works correctly.

    USAGE
          testCpSubSpace <SourceImageDir> <StartHeight> <StartWidth> \
        <CutHeight> <CutWidth>
          The program will display the origin image and the cut part, 
        out of the rectangle at [StH, StW, StH+CutH, StW+CutW],
        together, with both image transformed into 1-or-0 gray images,
        8-bit and 1-channel, with the shreshold of 128.
          One sample image is given along with the source code, at 
        ../../utility/ds.png. You may use it like 
        $ ./testCpSubSpace ../../utility/ds.png 50 50 100 100
